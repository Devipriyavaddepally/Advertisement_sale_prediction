# Advertisement_sale_prediction

This is a project to predict whether the customer buy's a advertised product or not
The prediction takes place based on Customer's Age, salary, Expenses and Savings.
I have used Logistic Regression, a machine learning algorithm to predict the outcome i.e., whether customer buy's a product or not

If the savings of a person is >= 10000 then the customer can buy the product, if not the customer don't buy the product.
